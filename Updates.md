# Unsupervised_RNAseq_Alignment

Please refer to this readme file as a status document

I have gone through the codes of the paper and have understood the functioning of the different parts.
Also ran the code on the dataset provided by the authors, the results match the results reported in the paper.

Will now work on replacing the label classifier by proposed feedforward network based decoder and run some tests on synthetic data

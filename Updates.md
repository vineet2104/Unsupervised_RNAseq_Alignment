# Unsupervised_RNAseq_Alignment

Please refer to this readme file as a status document

I have gone through the codes of the paper and have understood the functioning of the different parts.
Also ran the code on the dataset provided by the authors, the results match the results reported in the paper.

I have added the agreed decoder model and have used the original label classifier as a metric to evaluate the performance of the modified system.

Please check the results folder. It has 2 files corresponding to the results of the original model(without decoder, as prescribed in the paper) 
and the modified model(with our added decoder)
